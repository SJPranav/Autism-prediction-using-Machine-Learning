# 🧠 Autism Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on behavioral and personal attributes. It uses a classification model trained on real-world data.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: `train.csv` (uploaded)
- Features include responses to screening questions, age, gender, ethnicity, and more.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees)
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)

## 📊 Model Performance

- Accuracy Achieved: ~XX% (you can fill in actual values)
- Cross-validation, confusion matrix, and classification report were used for evaluation.

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
